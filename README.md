# Simplicity

---
Simplicity was a bot I made a while back in Lua and then JavaScript.

This repo is a rewrite of that bot in Rust, with an organized file structure to make it easier for anyone to fork.

**Note: To use this bot, you must have a file called 'SECRET' in the same directory as the executable that contains your token.**
